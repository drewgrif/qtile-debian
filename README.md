# This Installation was ONLY INTENDED FOR DEBIAN BULLSEYE (11) 

**RECOMMENDED: USE THE bookworm-scripts for an updated qtile install.**


==============================

These files were originally used during my personal dwm phase but then modified to supplement my [youtube video](https://youtu.be/ksz-PPKPnz0) on the subject.

```
sudo apt install git

git clone https://github.com/drewgrif/qtile-debian

cd qtile-debian

./install.sh (includes nerdfonts.sh unless commented)
```
